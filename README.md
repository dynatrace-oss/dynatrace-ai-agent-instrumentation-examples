# Dynatrace AI Agent instrumentation examples

This project demonstrates how to seamlessly integrate Dynatrace with AI agents to achieve robust observability, performance monitoring, and actionable insights. By instrumenting AI agents with Dynatrace, you gain the ability to monitor their behavior, track dependencies, and ensure optimal performance across complex environments.

Key Features:
- *End-to-End Observability*: Monitor AI agent interactions, dependencies, performance, and cost metrics in real time.
- *Actionable Insights*: Leverage Dynatrace's AI-powered analytics to identify bottlenecks, optimize resource utilization, and troubleshoot issues.
- *Seamless Integration*: Learn how to embed Dynatrace instrumentation into AI agents with minimal effort.


This repository is perfect for developers, DevOps engineers, and AI practitioners looking to enhance the reliability and scalability of their AI-powered applications. Whether you're building chatbots, recommendation engines, or autonomous systems, this guide will help you unlock the full potential of Dynatrace observability.
